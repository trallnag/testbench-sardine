# Contributing

Thank you for your interest in improving this project. Your contributions are
appreciated.

There are many ways to contribute, improving the documentation, submitting bug
reports and feature requests, giving feedback, or writing code.

If you have a trivial fix or improvement, go ahead and create a pull request.

If you plan something more involved, first raise an issue to discuss.

In addition to this document, consult [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) for
guidance regarding developing this project and [`RELEASE.md`](RELEASE.md) for
documentation of the release management process (if applicable).

Also consider taking a look at the development documentation at
[`docs/devel`](docs/devel). It contains more detailed documentation and other
assets.

Should you wish to work on an issue, please claim it first by commenting on the
GitHub issue that you want to work on it. This is to prevent duplicated efforts
from contributors on the same issue.

To submit changes, respect the following guidelines:

- Branch from the master branch and, if needed, rebase to the current main
  branch before submitting your pull request. If it doesn't merge cleanly with
  main you may be asked to rebase your changes.
- Commits should be as small as possible, while ensuring that each commit is
  correct independently (i.e., each commit should compile and pass tests).
- Update [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) if the contribution relevant for the
  changelog according to the
  [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0) specification.
- Ensure that your code has an appropriate set of tests which all pass.
- Ensure that your code adheres to the existing style in the code to which you
  are contributing.
- Title your pull request following
  [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) styling.
